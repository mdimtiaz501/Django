Instead of inheriting from the forms.Forms class, we will use forms.ModelForm
in our forms.py file. This helper class allows us to create a form from a 
pre-existing model.
Then we'll add an inline class Meta that provides information connecting the
model to the form.

forms.py ->
	from django import forms
	from .models import User

	class NewUserForm(forms.ModelForm):
	    #Form field go here		//security reason er jnno kono field use kora hoy na
					//custom validation er jnno
   	    class Meta:
        	model = User
       		fields = '__all__'	//fields attribute connect to model
					//__all__ grabs all the fields form
					//models.py file
	2nd option:
	    class Meta:
        	model = User
       		exclude = ['field1','field2']

	3rd option:
