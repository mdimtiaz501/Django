we would add the following to the project's urls.py

from django.conf.urls import include
urlpatterns = [
	url(r'^home/',include('FirstP.urls')),	//mane website er domain er por /home likhle FirstProject folder er
						//urls.py folder theke content eshe show korbe
	]

create a file named urls.py in the FirstProject app and if we write the code
	from FirstP import views		
	from django.conf.urls import url
	from django.conf.urls import include
	urlpatterns = [
		url(r'^$',views.index,name='index'),
	]

Then it'll print Hello boys
